BrawlView
=========

Given a file that BrawlLib can read, this program will open a window displaying all MDL0 models in the file. The camera will be zoomed out automatically, up to a certain amount, so it works for both stages and characters.
If no filename is specified, a file open dialog will be shown.
Models whose names contain "Shd" will be skipped.
